## FinTech Case Study

# The goal is to analyze the past, present and future of this company. I will be looking at their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. 

# Company: Solana 

**When was the company incorporated?**      
The company was created in November 2017.  
**Who are the founders of the company?**    
Solana was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko. He is the sole founder and the current CEO of Solana.   
**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**    
The name itself comes from Yakovenko’s favorite surfing spot, Solana Beach California. Yakovenko had spent most of his career in telecommunications and admits that at first, he wasn’t sold on the idea of cryptocurrency. Eventually he began mining Bitcoin and started to gain an understanding for how it worked. One night the idea for Solana just came to him in what he describes as a “caffeine induced fever dream at 4am”. The idea was that you could drastically improve blockchain transaction speeds by implementing a decentralized clock.   
**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**    
Solana has had four rounds of private funding and an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). At the time of the ICO they had received over 25 million dollars. While the bulk of its funding came from private investors Solana has 195 million of its 500 million coins allocated for public purchase and about 40 million of them currently circulating. As Solana’s popularity continues to grow the value of their coin will increase and they will receive more public funding.  

## Business Activities:

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**    
While Solana is a crypto currency it is primarily a blockchain company. Its primary goal is to complete transactions as fast and as affordable as possible. Their mission statement is “support all high-growth and high-frequency blockchain applications, and to democratize the world’s financial systems”.  

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**    
Solana is currently trying to partner with other businesses to use its blockchain technology. It is tough to measure this market size because blockchain technology can apply to so many different types of businesses. The best indication of Solana’s market size is its coin price, market cap, circulating supply and trading volume.     
	
**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**     
Solana capitalizes on a ton of competitive advantages. Its most notable is its speed of transactions. It can complete over 50,000 transactions per second (tps) and is expected to get even faster. This is way above well-known cryptos such as Bitcoin (5 tps) and Ethereum (15 tps). The second is its low fees. It only costs about .00000001 dollars per transaction while Ethereum costs about 2 dollars per transaction.   
**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**   
As stated above Solana uses its technology as a competitive advantage over other competitors. Solana is a blockchain technology. Blockchain is a type of ledger that records transaction safely and securely through a peer to peer network and while all blockchain companies use this Solana has eight specific factors that set it apart. They include Proof of History, Tower BTF, Turbine, Gulf Stream, Sealevel, Pipeline, Cloudbreak and Archivers. Of the eight Proof of History is by far its most innovative and valuable. It is a built-in clock that timestamps when every transaction occurs. This allows the nodes processing these transactions to communicate much more effectively and is the main reason for Solana’s impressive transaction speeds.  

## Landscape:

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**    
What is so unique about blockchain companies like Solana is that they are partnering with companies from all financial domains so it can be tough to categorize.   
**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**    
Blockchain is a fairly new field and Solana has only been around since late 2017 but there are certainly trends and innovations within this time period. Speed and scalability are the biggest trends in this space. Another pressing issue in this space is energy consumption.  New companies are emerging with faster technology or current companies are trying to scale up their software. Solana prides itself on its scalability potential and looks to be well positioned heading into the future.   

**What are the other major companies in this domain?**    
There are thousands of companies within this space. The two most notable are Bitcoin and Ethereum. To put it into perspective the size difference of the companies Bitcoin has a market cap of about 1 trillion, while Solana has a market cap of about 3 billion. Each company offers a slightly different spin on the underlying blockchain technology. It’s a highly competitive and ever-changing field and each day companies can go way up or way down.   


## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**    
Solana has so far made many commercial partnerships with varying types of companies. These companies include FTX, Audius, Terra and Chainlink. They have processed 5.5 billion transactions since March 2020. They are providing fast and affordable blockchain technology for the world.   
**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**    
A great measure of success in this domain is the performance of the company’s crypto coin. The coin is bought and sold by the public similar to a stock market, so it is a key indicator of a companies potential success or failure. Solana reached a new all time high of $11.79 on February 20th 2020. It has also had an astounding 1200% increase in price over the past year and the 33rd highest market cap in the crypto space. All great indications going forward.   

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**   
While it is achieving great success a lot of other similar companies are also experiencing tremendous growth. A very similar coin called Polkadot which was created only a year before Solana has experienced similar growth within the market. It has a 1300% growth rate over the past year and ranks 4th in highest market cap. Polkadot is currently trading around $37 while Solana is around $11. So while Solana is the younger company it should look to grow similarly to Polkadot in the future.    

## Recommendations  

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**    
I think a great way for coins like this to emerge from the rest of the pack would be to create a user friendly payment app similar to Venmo or Cash App. Blockchain technology offers a great deal of advantages but it is sometimes difficult for the mainstream to grasp. The transferring of coins can seem especially confusing to the average person.  Simpler apps that appeal to a much broader audience are a good way to gain new investors and buzz around a company.     

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**    
I think for new technologies such as blockchain your biggest problem is getting people to believe in them and trust them. A lot of it feels very fake or theoretical but if they were physically using an application it would make it become real. They would develop an understanding of it and want to see what else blockchain is capable of.   
**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**    
This would require no additional technologies. It would just take someone to design the app and write the code. As well as a lot of marketing.   
**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**    
The technology is already there but it is the marketing that needs to be different. Solana has all these competitive advantages but what it needs is backing and support. To do this you have to familiarize you market with the product.
